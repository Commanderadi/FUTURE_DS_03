# FUTURE_DS_03
ollege Event Feedback Analysis
Project Overview
This project, part of the Future Interns ðŸŽ“ program, focuses on analyzing student feedback from college events to derive actionable insights and improve campus life. Using data science tools, we process feedback data (ratings and potentially comments) to understand student satisfaction and identify areas for enhancement in future events.

What's Inside
This repository contains a Google Colab notebook (.ipynb file) that performs the following analysis:

Data Loading and Preparation: Loading student feedback data (simulated Google Forms export) using pandas.
Descriptive Statistics: Generating summary statistics for the feedback ratings.
Visualization of Ratings: Creating various charts (bar charts, histograms, box plots, heatmaps) to visualize the distribution, averages, spread, and correlations of student ratings across different feedback aspects.
Identification of Key Insights: Analyzing the visualizations and statistics to pinpoint areas of strength and weakness based on student feedback.
Recommendations for Improvement: Providing concrete suggestions for event organizers based on the analytical findings.
(Note: This analysis was performed on a dataset with ratings on a 1-10 scale. Sentiment analysis using NLP tools like TextBlob or VADER and analysis of 1-5 scale ratings would require datasets containing student comments and/or ratings in that format, which were not available for this specific analysis.)

Skills Demonstrated
Data cleaning & preparation with pandas
Creating bar charts, histograms, box plots, and heatmaps for reports using matplotlib and seaborn
Interpreting survey data to help make real decisions
Working in Google Colab
How to View and Use
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Open the .ipynb file in Google Colab.
Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
Example Insights
Based on the analysis in the notebook, you can find insights such as:

Average satisfaction scores for different aspects of the event.
Distribution of overall satisfaction among students.
Spread and consistency of ratings for various feedback criteria.
Correlation (or lack thereof) between different feedback aspects.
